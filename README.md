# Do-It

### Do-It is a project management web application (inspired by other project management web applications like Trello, ClickUp, Asana, etc) that helps drive productivity and collaboration. This is done by helping you keep all of your work and tasks in one place and also keep a proper track of it. Tasks can be broken down into achievable steps and give a more manageable work flow.
